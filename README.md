# File Services Interactive Menu

This Python project demonstrates a menu-driven program for working with text files. 
It focuses on practical Python skills like file handling, string manipulation, input validation, and control flow with loops.

## Features

* **Interactive Menu:** Users can choose from multiple services with clear prompts.
* **File Handling:** Read and process text files efficiently.
* **String Operations:** Sort unique words, reverse lines, and extract last N lines.
* **Input Validation:** Ensures users provide valid options and numbers.
* **Clean & Modular Code:** Functions are reusable and include clear docstrings.

## Menu Services

1. **sort** – Print all unique words in the file as a sorted list.
2. **rev** – Print each line from the file with characters reversed.
3. **last** – Print the last N lines of the file, with N provided by the user.
4. **0** – Exit the program.

## How to Run

Clone the repository and run the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/file-services-menu.git
cd file-services-menu
python file_services_menu.py
```
Follow the on-screen menu instructions.

## Example
```
Service menu:
sort - print sorted unique words
